## üöÄ Overview
GitFTP-Deploy bridges the gap between version control and web deployment by allowing developers to deploy Git repository changes directly to FTP/SFTP servers without leaving macOS. Instead of manually uploading changed files or relying on complex CI pipelines for simple projects, this tool automates the workflow, speeding up deploys and minimizing human error.

You pick a repo, configure your FTP/SFTP credentials, set the remote path, and every time you commit or push local changes (or select files), GitFTP-Deploy syncs only the changed files. Whether you maintain a small WordPress site, static HTML pages, or custom backend scripts, this utility ensures your site stays up-to-date with minimal fuss. Ideal for web developers, designers, freelancers, or anyone who wants faster, safer deployments without full CI/CD overhead.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About (Deep Dive)
Under the hood, GitFTP-Deploy is built to balance simplicity, reliability, and control:

- **Selective Syncing**  
  Only changed files are uploaded‚Äîno full folder uploads every time. This saves bandwidth and time.

- **Support for Git Tracking**  
  Tracks what has changed via Git diffs; supports ignoring files/folders via .gitignore or custom exclude rules.

- **FTP & SFTP Compatibility**  
  Works with both unencrypted FTP and secure SFTP; supports TLS, passive/active modes, and remote path mappings.

- **Project Profiles**  
  Maintain multiple deployment profiles (for example, staging vs production), each with its own server settings, paths, exclude lists.

- **Safe Deploy & Rollbacks**  
  Keeps track of last successful deploy, and can be configured to backup remote files or prompt before overwriting, offering a safety net against accidental data loss.

- **macOS-Native UI & Notifications**  
  Simple, clean user interface with drag-and-drop, file selection, progress indicators, error messages; macOS notifications inform you when deploy succeeds or fails.
